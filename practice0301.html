        <h2>Alice Chicken $14</h2>
        <p>Marinated chicken breasts with bacon and cheese are grilled and served with sautéed mushrooms and honey mustard dressing. Broiling chicken in this manner is a fantastic method to add that extra something!</p>

        <h2>Brandied Candied Sweet Potatoes $8</h2>
        <p>Because it differs from the usual mashed sweet potato recipes, this has been a Thanksgiving favorite of ours for many years.</p>
        
        <h2>Chocoloate Wraps $10</h2>
        <p>When I needed a distinctive, quick dessert for a special meal, I came up with this chocolate and peanut butter treat. The filled tortillas just take a few minutes to grill and have a chewy texture thanks to the marshmallows. Laurie Gwaltney (Laurie Gwaltney)</p>
