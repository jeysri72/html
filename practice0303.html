            <h2>Alice Spring Chicken $14</h2>
            <p>Marinated chicken breasts with bacon and cheese are grilled and served with sautéed mushrooms and honey mustard dressing. Broiling chicken in this manner is a fantastic method to add that extra something!</p>

            <h2>Brandied Candied Sweet Potatoes $8</h2>
            <p>Because it differs from the usual mashed sweet potato recipes, this has been a Thanksgiving favorite of ours for many years.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Chocoloate Wraps $10</h2>
            <p>When I needed a distinctive, quick dessert for a special meal, I came up with this chocolate and peanut butter treat. The filled tortillas just take a few minutes to grill and have a chewy texture thanks to the marshmallows. Laurie Gwaltney (Laurie Gwaltney)</p>
